# fau_summaries
These are high-level summaries of the courses in Autonomy Technologies Master's program at FAU. 
Note that these summaries are not comprehensive and are meant to be used as a quick reference.
P.S: I usually take notes with Obsidian and then convert the Markdown files to PDFs. Sometimes, the formatting may not be perfect in the PDFs.
